AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURING RAMPS, WITH
PRODUCTION CERTIFICATE WELL UNDERWAY

We are concurrently producing six Midnight aircraft, three of which are in final assembly
across our facilities. We are building these across our “golden manufacturing line” in Silicon
Valley and our high-volume facility in Georgia. In parallel, the FAA continued conducting
reviews and inspections of our manufacturing operations as part of our production certificate
efforts.

LA 2028 OLYMPICS & WHITE HOUSE EXECUTIVE
ORDER ADVANCE U.S. LAUNCH PLANS

The LA 2028 Olympic Games selected Archer as its Official Air Taxi Provider, helping align
our federal and local stakeholders around achieving our goal of FAA type certification and
scaled operations of Midnight. To enable this, we partnered with the U.S. Department of
Transportation, FAA, and the White House on an Executive Order in June 2025 to promote
American “dominance” in eVTOL aircraft and create a Presidential mandate for early U.S.
deployments as soon as next year.

UAE LAUNCH EDITION TAKES FLIGHT

We signed definitive agreements with our partners, Abu Dhabi Aviation and the Abu Dhabi
Investment Office, to activate our first of several planned Launch Edition programs globally.
As part of this, we delivered our first Midnight aircraft to the UAE, commenced our flight test
program in Abu Dhabi and expect initial commercial payments later this year.

ACCELERATED DEFENSE PROGRAM WITH TWO
STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS

Archer Defense is seeing strong demand from four of the major allied defense programs
worldwide. In an effort to accelerate our path to market, during the quarter we made two

strategic acquisitions: a patent portfolio and critical talent from Overair, and specialized defense

composite manufacturing assets from Mission Critical Composites in Southern California.

RAMPING MANUFACTURING
CAPABILITIES, PROGRESSING
FAA PRODUCTION CERTIFICATE

We continue to be focused in the near term on ramping our production capabilities to achieve a rate of 50 aircraft per
year across our ~700,000 square feet of manufacturing and test facilities. As previously discussed, the Midnight
aircraft we build during this new product introduction phase will be used in certification and early commercial
deployments.

We currently have six Midnight aircraft in various stages of production, three of which are in final assembly at our
Covington, Georgia and Silicon Valley facilities

In parallel, the FAA continued conducting reviews and inspections of our manufacturing operations as part of our
production certificate efforts

SILICON VALLEY, CALIFORNIA | Golden Line
During this new product introduction phase, we are utilizing a “golden manufacturing line” approach at one of our
Silicon Valley facilities for final assembly of our early Midnight builds.

COVINGTON, GEORGIA | High-Volume Manufacturing

We are using the lessons from the final assembly activities at our “golden manufacturing line” in Silicon Valley to
inform the design and ramp of our high-volume manufacturing operations in Georgia. In the early months of
operations at this facility, we have been focused on our manufacturing processes related to Midnight's fuselage

ACCELERATED DEFENSE
PROGRAM WITH TWO
STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS

Since announcing Archer Defense, we continue to see growing demand from four of the major
allied defense programs worldwide. For example, the United States Pentagon submitted a FY26
$13.4B budget allocation request for autonomous and military systems".

in an effort to accelerate our path to market, during the quarter we made two strategic acquisitions:

OVERAIR “
We acquired a patent portfolio and hired critical employees from Overair, a spin-off of La
Karem Aircraft. Karem Aircraft developed and manufactured advanced fixed-wing and overadir
rotary-wing aircraft focused on the use of high-efficiency tiltrotors.

i

MISSION CRITICAL COMPOSITES

We acquired key composite manufacturing assets and an approximately ~60,000
square foot manufacturing facility from Mission Critical Composites, a specialized
defense composite manufacturer in Southern California. These assets allow us to bring
core composite fabrication capabilities in-house, supporting our defense program needs
for rapid prototyping and iteration.

Q2 2025
Financial Review

We reference several non-GAAP metrics in the financial discussion that follows. Unless otherwise noted or defined, our
non-GAAP metrics are calculated by starting with the equivalent GAAP metric. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial
measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is provided below in the section titled “GAAP to Non-GAAP

Reconciliation”.

1) Non-GAAP total operating expenses is a financial measure adjusting total operating expenses for warrant expenses and stock-based compensation
2) Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure adjusting net loss for other income (expense), net, interest income, net, income tax expense, depreciation
and amortization expense, warrant expenses, and stock-based compensation.

CASH & LIQUIDITY

We ended the second quarter of 2025 with $1,724.0 million of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet and an
additional $6.5 million of restricted cash. These ending cash balances represents the highest ever watermark for our
quarter-end cash balances. Our second quarter of 2025 cash balances increased by $693.6 million from the first quarter
of 20285, primarily due to the $850.0 million gross proceeds from the registered direct offering, partially offset by cash used

in operations and investing.

For the second quarter of 2025, cash used in operating and investing activities was $127.5 million, which included certain
one-time investments associated with strategic asset acquisitions.

TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES

Our second quarter 2025 total operating expenses represent investments required to achieve the key elements of our
commercialization plan. We continued to invest in the development, test, certification and production activities for our
aircraft. We also expanded investments in our go-to-market strategy and support infrastructure to enable the early
bring-up of our air taxi operations globally.

Total GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2025 were $176.1 million, which increased by $32.1 million from
the first quarter of 2025, driven by investments in people and vendor related spend to support our current phase of
development, testing efforts and operational scale up. Total GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2025
increased by $54.9 million from the second quarter of 2024, due to similar reasons mentioned above.

Total non-GAAP operating expenses (which are GAAP operating expenses less stock-based compensation and warrant
expenses, a reconciliation for which is provided in the financial statement section of this letter) for the second quarter of
2025 were $123.5 million, which increased by $10.4 million from the first quarter of 2025, and increased $27.1 million from
the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to the investments made in people-related costs in support of achieving our
commercialization plans.

NET LOSS AND ADJUSTED EBITDA

Net loss for the second quarter of 2025 was $206.0 million, which increased by $112.6 million from the first quarter of
2025, primarily due to the $82.0 million non-cash decrease in other income (expense), net driven by the change in fair
value of warrant liability, and the $32.1 million increase total operating expenses as mentioned above.

Net loss for the second quarter of 2025 increased by $99.1 million from the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to the
non-cash decrease in other income (expense), net, and by the increasing total operating expenses as mentioned above.

For the second quarter of 2025, adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $118.7 million, an increase of $9.7 million from the first
quarter of 2025, as we continued to execute to our aircraft program development milestones and manufacturing ramp.
Adjusted EBITDA loss increased by $24.9 million from the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to the investments we
have made in people-related spend to support our current phase of development, testing efforts and manufacturing scale
up, as well as increased spend with our suppliers.

Q3 2025 FINANCIAL ESTIMATES
We anticipate Adjusted EBITDA to be a loss of $110 million to $130 million for the third quarter of 2025.

We have not reconciled our Adjusted EBITDA estimates because certain items that impact non-GAAP metrics are
uncertain or out of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted. In particular, stock-based compensation expense and
change in fair value of warrants is impacted by the future fair market value of our common stock and warrants along with
other factors, all of which are difficult to predict, subject to frequent change, or not within our control. The actual amount of
these expenses during 2025 will have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results. Accordingly, a
reconciliation of non-GAAP metrics is not available without unreasonable effort.

GAAP to Non-GAAP
Reconciliation (cont.)

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

To supplement our condensed consolidated financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use the following
non-GAAP financial measures: Non-GAAP total operating expenses and Adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of these
financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information
prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with
the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, these non-GAAP financial measures have no
standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and
many of the adjustments to the GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and may be reflected
in our financial results for the foreseeable future. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial
measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations
by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.

We believe that the use of non-GAAP financial measures help us evaluate our business and financial performance, identify
trends impacting our business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe
that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of our financial statements provides useful supplemental data
that, while not a substitute for GAAP financial measures, can offer insight in the review of our operating and financial results
and enables investors to more fully understand our performance and cash trends by removing the effects of certain non-cash
expenses and non-recurring items.

We excluded items in the following general categories from one or more of our non-GAAP financial measures, certain of which
are described below:

— STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE We exclude stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense,
from these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental
information on our operating results and enhances our ability and the ability of the investors to understand the impact of
non-cash stock-based compensation on our operating results.

— WARRANT EXPENSE & GAINS OR LOSSES FROM REVALUATION OF WARRANTS Expense from our common
stock warrants issued to Stellantis, which is recurring (but non-cash) and gains or losses from change in fair value of
public and private warrants from revaluation will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future. We exclude
warrant expense and gains or losses from change in fair value for similar reasons to our stock-based compensation
expense.

Edition” commercialization program and associated deployment of aircraft and timing of commercial payments, Archer
Defense, and international expansion. In addition, this shareholder letter refers to initial agreements that contemplate the
future execution by the parties of additional binding definitive agreements incorporating the terms outlined in each
memorandum of understanding, which definitive agreements may not be completed or may contain different terms than
those set forth in each initial agreement.

Forward-looking statements are based upon various estimates and assumptions, as well as information known to us as of
the date hereof, and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially due to a
variety of factors, including: the early stage nature of our business and our past and projected future losses; our ability to
design, manufacture and deliver our aircraft; risks associated with indicative orders from certain third parties for our
aircraft, which are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and/or further negotiation and reaching mutual
agreement on certain material terms, and the risk that such parties cancel such orders or never place them; risks
associated with being in the early stages of developing our defense program, and our inability to ensure that we will
achieve some or any of the expected benefits of the program or that we will be successful in winning a bid to develop
aircraft for the U.S. Department of Defense or any other military agency; risks associated with the expansion of our
planned lines of business; risks associated with the current and future international expansion of our business and
operations; our ability to realize operating and financial results forecasts which rely in large part upon assumptions and
analyses that we have developed; our ability to effectively market electric air transportation as a substitute for
conventional methods of transportation, following receipt of governmental operating authority; our ability to compete
effectively in the UAM and eVTOL industries; risks related to the operation of our UAM ecosystem in densely populated
metropolitan areas and heavily regulated airports; our ability to obtain any required certifications, licenses, approvals, or
authorizations from governmental authorities; our ability to achieve our business milestones, such as commencing the
manufacturing of our aircraft and launching products and services, on anticipated timelines; our dependence on suppliers
for the parts and components in our aircraft, which are subject to uncertainties that could affect our operating results,
including tariffs or other trade restrictions; our ability to ramp up to commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities;
regulatory requirements and other obstacles outside of our control that slow market adoption of electric aircraft, such as
the inability to obtain and maintain adequate vertiport infrastructure; our ability to attract, integrate, manage, train and
retain qualified personnel and key employees; natural disasters, outbreaks and pandemics, economic, social, weather,
growth constraints and regulatory conditions or other circumstances affecting metropolitan areas; the potential for losses
and adverse publicity stemming from any accidents involving small aircraft, helicopters or charter flights, and in particular
from accidents involving electric aircraft or lithium-ion battery cells, or test flights of our prototype eVTOL aircraft; risks
associated with indexed price escalation clauses in aircraft contracts, which could subject us to losses if we have cost
overruns or if increases in costs exceed the applicable escalation rate; our ability to address a wide variety of extensive
and evolving laws and regulations, including data privacy and security laws; our ability to protect our intellectual property
rights from unauthorized use by third parties; our ability to obtain additional capital to pursue our business objectives and
respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances; cybersecurity risks to our various systems
and software.

Forward-Looking Statements &
Disclaimers (cont. )

The indicative operational goals referenced in this document reflect numerous estimates and assumptions with respect to
general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters
specific to the our business, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the our control including,
among other things, the timing of the receipt of required certifications, licenses, approvals or authorizations from
governmental authorities, the ramping up of manufacturing at our manufacturing facilities, the actual price paid per
aircraft, and the costs of manufacturing the aircraft, consumer demand for our aircraft and the other matters described

The inclusion of the operational goals in this document is not an admission or representation that such information is
